### Gaute Holmin âš¡ 

I'm from Oslo, Norway. Currently employed in the Research & Development department at SuperOffice AS. 

I graduated from "Den Polytekniske HÃ¸gskole" in the year 2000, specializing in software development and network administration, but I wouldn't really say I've ever worked as a developer. I've mostly worked as a consultant and/or presales in the Application Performance Management space. 

Here you will find short scripts, hacks and similar, either related to my work or to personal projects that i randomly update. 

You can also [follow me on Mastodon](https://snabelen.no/@gauteweb).
