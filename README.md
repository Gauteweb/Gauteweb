### ðŸ“Œ Introduction 

I'm from Oslo, Norway. Currently employed at Sopra Steria as a Product Offering Manager within Observability & Monitoring. 

I graduated from "Den Polytekniske HÃ¸gskole" in the year 2000, specializing in software development and network administration, but I wouldn't really say I've ever worked as a developer. I've mostly worked as a consultant and/or presales in the Observability space (_long before it was called "observability"_). 

In my Github repositories you will mostly find old scripts, hacks and similar, either related to my work or to personal projects that may or may not be updated in the future. I cannot guarantee that they work anymore ;-)

If you would like to get in thouch, please a href="https://mikrobloggen.no/@gauteweb" rel="me">follow me on Mastodon</a> or [join my Discord server for a chat](https://discord.gg/sAE5eX4V2V).
